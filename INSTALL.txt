Installation
============================================================

----------
| Global |
----------

python setup.py install

---------
| Local |
---------

python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME

which will install into:

$HOME/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages

You will need to manually create:

$HOME/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages

and add it to your PYTHONPATH environment variable (otherwise you will get an 
error -- btw run the command above once to find the correct value for X.Y).

If using pip, the following should work; however, you will need to enter credentials:

pip install git+https://github.com/ohsu-computational-biology/ccc_client
